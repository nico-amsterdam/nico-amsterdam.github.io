# Sustainable Earth

## Humans will not be the next dinosaurs

With a sustainable earth, I mean sustainable for humankind. It's unlikely that sappiens will survive as long as dinosaurs did, if you look at our self destructing behavior. Yes, humans are social. You take care of your family. You vote for what's best for your country. But, this is at the cost of others. You are willing to share food as long as your family has plenty. You will give somebody a job, as your family has the better jobs. If others react aggressively because they don't have enough to live reasonable, you think they are unreasonable. After all, you earned it.   
But wouldn't it be nice, if your children, your grand children, and your grand grand children can still live reasonable comfortable on this earth?
Wouldn't it be nice, if not only the rich has a decent live?
But with more than 9 billion people on earth in 2050, this will be a big challenge.
