# Sustainable Earth

## Humans will not be the next dinosaurs

With a sustainable earth, I mean sustainable for humankind. It's unlikely that sappiens will survive as long as dinosaurs did, if you look at our self destructing behavior. Yes, humans are social. You take care of your family. You vote for what's best for your country. But, this is at the cost of others. You are willing to share food as long as your family has plenty. You will give somebody a job, as your family has the better jobs. If others react aggressively because they don't have enough to live reasonable, you think they are unreasonable. After all, you earned it.   
But wouldn't it be nice, if your children, your grand children, and your grand grand children can still live reasonable comfortable on this earth?
Wouldn't it be nice, if not only the rich has a decent live?
But with more than 9 billion people on earth in 2050, this will be a big challenge.

## Face the truth

Ok, we could talk about pollution in our own food chain. The fish we eat contains heavy metals, micro- and nanoplastics, if they are not dead because of pesticides, or not there because of overfishing. The list of endangered species is long. Bumblebees are going extinct so we have to use drones to pollinate plants. That's mad. Yes, W\we live in a mad world.
But some things we can see coming. 
When do we finally react and change our habbits? It's not only politics, it's also the things we do or don't do, the stuff we buy or through away. 
I guess, most people are in a state of denial. If you are poor you don't have the means, if you ar rich, you don't have the incentive.
